## Overview

This document explains how the video essay script "The Weaponization of Words: How Goebbels's 'Total War' Speech Reveals the Dark Power of Rhetoric" meets each requirement outlined in the assignment directions for full credit.

---

## 1. CLEAR AND EFFECTIVE THESIS (Answering the Three Required Questions)

**Requirement:** "Include a clear and effective thesis or topic statement that answers my three questions: What is happening, what are we talking about; How is it happening, how are we talking about it, and why is it happening; Why are we talking about this, who cares and why do they care, what are the implications of whatever we've found out so far."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

The thesis statement appears at approximately 1:15 in the script:

> "Today, I want to explore how Goebbels weaponized language to unify a nation through fear, borrowed symbols, and the erasure of individual identity—and why understanding these techniques matters now more than ever. Because the same rhetorical weapons that mobilized Germany in 1943 are still being deployed today, in our politics, our media, and our everyday discourse."

**Question 1 - What is happening, what are we talking about?**
- We are analyzing Goebbels's "Total War" speech from February 18, 1943
- The speech was delivered after Germany's devastating defeat at Stalingrad
- Goebbels used rhetoric to transform national tragedy into a rallying cry for total war

**Question 2 - How is it happening? Why is it happening?**
- Through three specific techniques: borrowed symbols, fear-based appeals, and the erasure of individual identity (consubstantiality)
- The speech uses manufactured consensus (hand-picked audience), rhetorical questions as commands, and historical symbolism
- Burke's theories of logology and consubstantiality explain WHY these techniques work psychologically

**Question 3 - Why are we talking about this? Who cares? What are the implications?**
- These same techniques are used in modern politics, media, and social media
- Understanding these techniques helps us resist manipulation today
- The implications extend to anyone exposed to persuasive messaging (i.e., everyone)

---

## 2. PROJECT LENGTH

**Requirement:** "The work for this project should be equivalent to a 2000-word essay (i.e., an 8-12 min. video)"

### How This Requirement Is Met:

- **Word Count:** Approximately 2,100 words of spoken content
- **Estimated Runtime:** 10-11 minutes at natural speaking pace
- The script includes detailed timing markers showing content distribution across the runtime
- All five sections plus introduction, conclusion, and reflective elements fit within the 8-12 minute requirement

---

## 3. CLEAR AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE

**Requirement:** "Develop a clear audience and purpose. Think about who would benefit from your research and who has the power to take action in response to your argument. Show an awareness of likely audience values and relationship to the topic under discussion."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

**Intended Audience:**
- General educated audience interested in history, politics, and media literacy
- College students studying rhetoric, communication, or history
- Citizens concerned about propaganda in modern political discourse

**Purpose:**
- To demonstrate how historical propaganda techniques remain relevant today
- To equip viewers with the analytical tools to recognize rhetorical manipulation
- To move beyond academic analysis toward practical media literacy

**Awareness of Audience Values:**
- The script assumes viewers value critical thinking and democratic participation
- It acknowledges modern examples (social media, political rallies) that connect to viewers' lived experiences
- The reflective sections directly address the viewer ("Would I have resisted? Would you?")
- The conclusion explicitly states actionable takeaway: learning to ask "Am I thinking, or am I being thought?"

## 4. APPROPRIATE MEDIUM/GENRE FOR AUDIENCE

**Requirement:** "Choose a multimodal medium (incorporating more than just written elements) and genre that suits the evidence you want to share and the audience you hope to reach."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

**Why Video Essay Is the Appropriate Medium:**

1. **Audio-Visual Evidence:** The original speech was an audio performance. A video essay allows viewers to HEAR Goebbels's voice and SEE the crowd's reactions—making the manipulation visceral rather than abstract.

2. **Multimodal Integration:** The script incorporates:
   - Narration (written text performed aloud)
   - Historical footage and photographs
   - Text overlays and graphics
   - Diagrams and animations explaining rhetorical concepts
   - Modern comparison footage
   - Direct address to camera for reflective sections

3. **Audience Accessibility:** Video essays reach broader audiences than academic papers. Platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and educational sites make this content discoverable.

4. **Genre Awareness:** The script follows video essay conventions (direct address, visual evidence, accessible explanations of theory) while maintaining academic rigor.

## 5. REVISION FROM ORIGINAL ESSAY

**Requirement:** "Take the revision aspect of the assignment seriously: do not simply 'copy and paste' an essay into a new medium. Rethink and challenge your previous work to make it something new and newly impactful."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

**Major Revisions from Original Essay:**

1. **Restructured for Visual Medium:**
   - Original essay: five-paragraph academic structure
   - Video essay: six sections with visual markers, timing cues, and production notes

2. **Added Contemporary Relevance:**
   - Original essay: focused solely on 1943 speech
   - Video essay: explicitly connects historical techniques to modern social media, political rallies, and filter bubbles

3. **Shifted Tone:**
   - Original essay: academic third-person analysis
   - Video essay: direct address ("I want to explore," "you feel," "Would you?")

4. **Added Reflective Elements:**
   - Five integrated reflective notes throughout the script
   - These reflections explain adaptation choices in real-time

5. **Expanded Thesis:**
   - Original thesis: focused on describing Goebbels's techniques
   - Video thesis: explicitly argues for contemporary relevance and viewer action

6. **New Material:**
   - Added Longerich source on audience staging
   - Added modern examples not in original essay
   - Added production/visual elements that couldn't exist in written form

## 6. INTEGRATED REFLECTIVE ELEMENT

**Requirement:** "Everyone agreed to include/integrate a reflective element in their revised multimodal project... You could reflect as you go, so section by section."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

The script includes **six distinct reflective moments** integrated throughout:

1. **Introduction Reflection (1:15):** Explains the shift from viewing the speech as historical artifact to understanding it as a warning for the present.

2. **Section 1 Reflection (3:15):** Discusses how adapting for video revealed the visceral power of hearing manufactured consent.

3. **Section 2 Reflection (5:15):** Explains the challenge of translating Burke's abstract concepts into visual presentations.

4. **Section 3 Reflection (7:15):** Personal reflection on whether the viewer (and creator) would have resisted.

5. **Section 4 Reflection (8:45):** Discusses discovering new patterns through the process of visual mapping.

6. **Final Reflection (10:30-11:00):** Comprehensive reflection addressing which assignment was adapted, why video essay was the right medium, key rhetorical revisions made, what would be done differently, and how the creator's perspective changed through the process.

**Why Section-by-Section Reflection:**
This structure was chosen because it models the analytical process for viewers. Rather than saving all reflection for the end, viewers see how adaptation choices were made in real-time, which demonstrates the rhetorical thinking the assignment asks students to develop.

## 7. STANDALONE ARTIFACT

**Requirement:** "Your adaptation must be a standalone artifact, one that 'speaks for itself.' For instance, if proposing a Ted Talk, record yourself giving the talk and submit that recording rather than just submitting slides."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

- The script is designed to be filmed and produced as a complete video
- All necessary production elements are specified (visual cues, audio notes, timing)
- The video would be self-contained—no additional materials needed to understand the argument
- Works Cited is integrated into the video itself (scrolling credits)
- A separate written Works Cited is also provided for instructor records

**Delivery/Venue Plan:**
- Platform: YouTube (unlisted or educational channel)
- Alternative: Course learning management system
- Potential reach: Educational video essay community

---

## 8. SOURCE INTEGRATION

**Requirement:** "Look at examples of your chosen medium/genre to learn how they responsibly incorporate sources and evidence. Cite all sources appropriately for the form of your project: your audience should be able to track down your sources."

### How This Requirement Is Met:

**Five Sources (Minimum Required):**

1. **Burke, Kenneth. *A Rhetoric of Motives*.** (Primary theoretical framework)
   - Cited multiple times in spoken narration
   - Visual text overlays for key quotes

2. **Goebbels, Joseph. "Total War Speech."** (Primary text being analyzed)
   - Direct quotes in narration
   - Archival audio clips
   - Subtitled German with English translation

3. **Longerich, Peter. *Goebbels: A Biography*.** (Historical context on audience staging)
   - Used in Section 1 to support claim about manufactured consensus

4. **Pratkanis, Anthony, and Elliot Aronson. *Age of Propaganda*.** (Modern propaganda analysis)
   - Informs contemporary relevance section

5. **Welch, David. *The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda*.** (Historical context)
   - Supports claims about German propaganda norms

**Citation Style for Video:**
- In-video text citations for direct quotes
- Verbal attribution ("As Burke argues..." "Historian Peter Longerich notes...")
- Full Works Cited in end credits
- Separate written Works Cited document for submission

## 9. PRESENTATION REFLECTION CRITERIA

**Requirement (from Presentation section, now integrated):** "Which assignment did you adapt, for what audience and purpose? What genre/medium did you choose, and why is it suitable for this audience? Then, explain and show examples of several key rhetorical choices and revisions you made to adapt your project for this medium and audience. What did you learn about working in this genre? What would you do differently if you had it to do over again? How did your argument or perspective change through this process?"

### How These Questions Are Addressed in the Integrated Reflections:

| Question | Where Addressed |
|----------|----------------|
| Which assignment did you adapt? | Final Reflection: "I adapted Assignment 1—my Rhetorical Analysis essay—into this video essay" |
| For what audience and purpose? | Final Reflection: "anyone who consumes media and wants to recognize manipulation" |
| Why is video suitable? | Final Reflection: "Video lets you hear and see propaganda in action, not just read about it" |
| Key rhetorical choices? | Final Reflection: "shifting from detached analysis to direct engagement—showing the footage, playing the audio" |
| What did you learn? | Final Reflection: "learning to protect myself—and hopefully, you—from the same tricks still being used today" |
| What would you do differently? | Final Reflection: "I'd include even more modern examples earlier to hook the audience faster" |
| How did perspective change? | Final Reflection: "I started thinking I was studying history, but I ended up realizing I was learning to protect myself" |

## CONCLUSION

This video essay script demonstrates thorough engagement with all assignment requirements. By transforming an academic rhetorical analysis into a multimodal video essay, the project:

1. Makes abstract rhetorical concepts accessible through visual demonstration
2. Connects historical propaganda to contemporary media concerns
3. Models reflective practice through integrated commentary
4. Meets all technical requirements for length, sources, and format

The adaptation process itself became part of the argument: just as Goebbels's choice of medium (live oratory with radio broadcast) shaped his message's impact, my choice to analyze his speech through video allows viewers to experience the manipulation rather than merely read about it.
